TechFix System - Service-Oriented Application
TechFix is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) project developed to manage and streamline IT service requests. Built using Visual Studio .NET, this application emphasizes service reusability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. The system is structured with multiple services that handle various functions within a client-server model, allowing for efficient request processing and management. Designed with clear, modular services, TechFix demonstrates best practices in SOA by enabling scalable and flexible service interactions. This project includes well-documented source code, design diagrams, and a client interface, all aimed at providing a smooth and user-centered experience for service request management.
